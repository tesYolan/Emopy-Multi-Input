# Emotion recognition from face features
This project is aimed to train model that detects emotion from face image.
## Install prerequisites
### Using conda
```
# with conda
conda env update
python get_models.py
# to activate environment
source activate emotion-recogntion-snet-agent
```
### Using pip
```
# to utilize pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python get_models.py
```
### Using docker
```
# With to run with nvidia-docker
docker build Dockerfile.gpu -t . singnet:emopy-gpu

# To run on CPU
docker build . -t singnet:emopy-cpu
```
## How to preprocess datasets
This proejct uses [CK+ dataset](http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/) and  [Kaggle fer2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data).  
The dataset should be saved inside single directory which contains ```train``` and ```test``` folders.
* To extract kaggle's dataset follow the instruction to download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) 
  * Extract the dataset 
  * Inside this projects directory run the following code on terminal
```
python -m preprocess_fer -d /path-to-fer2013.csv-extracted 
```
* To process the ck+ dataset go to [this repository](https://github.com/mitiku1/Ck-dataset-preprocess)
* After preprocessing both dataset merge the two datasets mannually



### How to run training program
The four inputs model can be trained by three steps
* **shape_predictor should be inside root directory of this project. Shape predictor can be downloaded to project using the following script.**
```
cd /path-to-project
wget "http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2"
bzip2 -d shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2

# or
python get_models.py
```
Training program can be run using the following command
```
python -m train [options]
```
Option to train program are
  * -d : Dataset directory path that contains train and test folders
  * -e : Number of epochs to train the model
  * -b : Training batch size
  * -s : Steps per epoch
  * -f : This option specifies the type of model to train. the options can be 'image', 'dlib' or 'all'. The default is 'all'. If user enters option that is not from ('image', 'dlib', 'all') then program continues with default option. Before training the 'all' model type the other two models should be trained and saved inside 'logs/models/' folder.
  * -l : learning rate
  * -i : image input shape


#### Step 1 - Training image input model
``` 
python -m train [options] -f image 
```
#### Step 3 - Training dlib features input model
``` 
python -m train [options] -f dlib 
```
#### Step 3 - Training the main model
``` 
python -m train [options] 
```

### Running Demo program
``` 
python -m demo [options]
```  
Options for demo program are
* -j : model json file
* -w : model weights
* -i : Face image source. This could be either `image`, `video` or `webcam`. Defualt is webcam.
* -p : Path to source file. If options -i is webcam this is not necessary.

## Requirements
* keras >= 2.0
* tensorflow >= 1.5
* dlib
* opencv >= 3.1
* scikit-image
* numpy 
* pandas
### Using as singularitynet service
Trained models are available to be run as services to provide emotional results for image currently. It's based on the (alpha-service-example)[https://github.com/singnet/alpha-service-example]. And thus most of the parts are similar. 
```
cp snet.config.example snet.config 
# add private key on snet.config
  `"PRIVATE_KEY": "#PRIVATEKEY GOES HERE"`
python run-snet-service.py --daemon-config-path snet.config

# to test
python test_rpc_call.py
```
### Accessing on Daap
Go to http://alpha.singularitynet.io/ to create a job
#### TODO
* Better data responses to queries. As it stands we just serialize the data as string. But it's better to utilize grpcs to have consistent message format to communicate with other services or just for single user. 
* Persistant hosting to make it work always
